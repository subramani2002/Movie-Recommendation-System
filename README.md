# MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
**Summary:**
The project involves creating a Movie Recommendation System using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and implementing it through Streamlit. The dataset for the project is sourced from Kaggle. CountVectorizer, a method in NLP, is utilized to convert textual information from the dataset into numerical vectors, enabling the system to analyze and recommend movies based on their textual attributes. The user interface is developed using Streamlit, providing an interactive platform for users to receive personalized movie recommendations.
